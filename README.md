# Bundestag Lobbyregister Data

This workflow downloads a daily copy of the [Bundestag's lobbyregister](https://www.lobbyregister.bundestag.de/) (detailed version). This data can be found in the /data directory

A detailed description of the data [can be found here (in German)](https://www.bundestag.de/resource/blob/874134/8a89a806027c9f3217ebaddee9840641/Dokumentation-JSON-Downloads-data.pdf)

_While the lobbyregister IT infrastructure is updated to conform to the new iteration, the download of JSON-data is not available. According to my information, JSON is supposed to be available again at the end of April._
